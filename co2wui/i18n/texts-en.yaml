    welcome: Co<sub>2</sub>mpas is a simulation tool, developed  by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre for supporting EU Regulations 1152 and 1153/2017 introduced by Directorate General for Climate Action (DG CLIMA). 
             It is a backward-looking longitudinal-dynamics CO2 and fuel-consumption simulator for light-duty M1 & N1 vehicles (cars and vans), specially crafted to estimate the CO2 emissions of vehicles over the NEDC testing procedure based on the emissions and vehicle operation data measured over the WLTP test procedure during vehicle type-approval. Co<sub>2</sub>mpas is open source and licensed under the European Union Public Licence.
    hints: 
        run co2mpas: In this section, Co<sub>2</sub>mpas is executed. 
                Begin to choose one or more files to use as input for your Co<sub>2</sub>mpas simulation. 
                Press Confirm to proceed.
run:
    download template: Press <b>download</b> to retrieve the latest Co<sub>2</sub>mpas input template.
    run co2mpas: To execute Co<sub>2</sub>mpas press the button <b>Run simulation</b>.
    hints:
        why ta disabled: "TA mode could be disabled for various reasons: check that the encryption and signature keys are uploaded and that there are no advanced options selected that are in contrast with TA mode."
    intro: In this section, Co<sub>2</sub>mpas is executed. Choose one or more input file(s). Press <b>Run simulation</b> to proceed. 
    view results: The log of your past simulations is shown here below. You can retrieve your previous simulation results by clicking the <b>links</b> in the table.
    options:
        only declaration mode: Use only the declaration data.
        hard validation: It is an extra validation of the inserted input data. If the data do not seem legit, the software will stop the simulation and provide an error message.
        enable selector: The default model selection criteria are to use the calibrated models from WLTP-H data to predict WLTP-H and NEDC-H and from WLTP_L data to predict WLTP-L and NEDC-L. On the contrary, if the selector is enabled, the function extract_calibrated_model detects the best macro-model for prediction (from WLTP-H/L). The selection is performed according to the model’s score, which is the model capability to reproduce the input data.
        only summary: By selecting this option, Co2mpas provides as output only the summary file (i.e. an excel containing only one row per vehicle simulated).
        custom conf file: Use a custom configuration file previously uploaded
sync:
    synchronise data: Synchronization should be performed if time-series signals are time-shifted and/or recorded with different sampling rates. To synchronize and re-sample time series, library syncing is used.

    prompt: Load your synchronisation input file. Then click <b>Synchronise data</b>.
keys:
    load keys: "<b>For TA and TS use only</b>: upload the provided key files to encrypt the output of the Co<sub>2</sub>mpas simulation and send it to the DICE3 server, as EU regulations 1152 and 1153/2017."
conf:
    description: The configuration file (.yaml) is used to overwrite the default variables of the physical model.
    usage: 'You can use the configuration file only in <b>engineering mode</b>. Choose and upload a new configuration file for the Run Co<sub>2</sub>mpas procedure.
        <p>How to use it:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>download the template (click <a id="template-link" href="/conf/template">here</a>). This step is necessary only if you do not already have a valid configuration file</li>
        <li>modify it according to your parameters.</li>
        <li>upload it by pressing choose a configuration file. NB your file will be rewritten every time you upload a new one, and it will always be named conf.yaml</li>
        <li>flag the checkbox <b>use custom configuration file</b> under Advanced options in Run simulation. Please note that the checkbox is only available if the configuration file has been successfully uploaded.</li>

        <br/>
        <p><strong>N.B.</strong> conf.yaml works ONLY in <b>engineering mode</b>.</p>'
