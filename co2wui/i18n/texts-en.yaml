    welcome: Co<sub>2</sub>mpas is a simulation tool, developed  by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre for supporting EU Regulations 1152 and 1153/2017 introduced by Directorate General for Climate Action (DG CLIMA). 
             It is a backward-looking longitudinal-dynamics CO2 and fuel-consumption simulator for light-duty M1 & N1 vehicles (cars and vans), specially crafted to estimate the CO2 emissions of vehicles over the NEDC testing procedure based on the emissions and vehicle operation data measured over the WLTP test procedure during vehicle type-approval. Co<sub>2</sub>mpas is open source and licensed under the European Union Public Licence.
    hints: 
        run co2mpas: In this section, Co<sub>2</sub>mpas is executed. 
                Begin to choose one or more files to use as input for your Co<sub>2</sub>mpas simulation. 
                Press Confirm to proceed.
run:
    download template: Press <b>download</b> to retrieve the latest Co<sub>2</sub>mpas input template.
    run co2mpas: To execute Co<sub>2</sub>mpas press the button <b>Run simulation</b>.
    hints:
        why ta disabled: "TA mode could be disabled for various reasons: check that the encryption and signature keys are uploaded and that there are no advanced options selected that are in contrast with TA mode."
    intro: In this section, Co<sub>2</sub>mpas is executed. Choose one or more input file(s). Press <b>Run simulation</b> to proceed. 
    view results: The log of your past simulations is shown here below. You can retrieve your previous simulation results by clicking the <b>links</b> in the table.
    options:
        only declaration mode: Use only the declaration data.
        hard validation: Add extra data validations. Extra validations to the input data that are inserted. If the data do not seem legit, a good example are the currects for example, it will stop the simulation and provide a message that something is wrong with the data. In previous versions it was Soft validation(in my opinion better), where in case something seemed wrong but still you wanted to be simulated, then you had to add this flag.
        enable selector: Enable the selection of the best model to predict both H/L cycles. CO2MPAS consists of several models. If the user provides both WLTP-H and WLTP-L data, the same models will be calibrated twice, according to the data provided by each configuration. If the option model selector is switched on, CO2MPAS will use the model that provides the best scores, no matter if the model was calibrated with another cycle. For example, if the alternator model of the High configuration is better, the same model will be used to predict the Low configuration as well.
        only summary: Do not save vehicle outputs, just the summary. CO2MPAS in regular mode, provides in each run, except of the full output with a lot of info and timeseries created from the model, a summary file that contains only one row per vehicle simulated. In this row it has few data, and the most important are the declared and simulated values for every sub-phase (e.g Low, High) of every cycle (e.g NEDC). Selecting this option, it will provide only this file, and not the full output.
        custom conf file: Use a custom configuration file previously uploaded
sync:
    synchronise data: Synchronization should be performed if time-series signals are time-shifted and/or recorded with different sampling rates. To synchronize and re-sample time series, library syncing is used.

    prompt: Load your datasync input file. Then click <b>Synchronise data</b>.   
keys:
    load keys: "<b>For TA and TS use only</b>: upload the provided key files to encrypt the output of the Co<sub>2</sub>mpas simulation and send it to the DICE3 server, as EU regulations 1152 and 1153/2017."
conf:
    description: A precompiled file to overwrite the input variables of the physical model can be generated and downloaded.
    usage: You can use the configuration file only in engineering mode. Choose and upload a new configuration file for the Run Co2mpas procedure.
